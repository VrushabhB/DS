Type of Design Pattrens

Creational Patterns
  --> Control the creation process of objects
Types
  --> Class design pattern
  --> Constructor pattern
  --> singleton pattern
  --> Factory pattern

Structural Patterns
  --> focus on how to properly organize our code
Types
  --> Modul pattern - single pice of code in function / or pure functions 
  --> Facade pattern - hiding complexity - react project 
 --> Flyweight pattern - 7
        --> it is a method to minimize recreating same item twice
        --> Therefore Minimize memory impact
        --> used by browser to save the images in memory so they dont load twice
        --> It's similar to singleton pattern 
  --> MVC pattern-modal->view->-contoller
        --> Defines how an app should be split (modal,view,controller)
        --> View can have access to the modal as well as controller
  --> MVP pattern(based on MVC) - view->presentar->modal
        --> Similar as MVC but view cant direclty comunicate with controller
        --> backbone js is based on MVP
  --> MVVM/MVVC(react/angular) pattern
        --> view ->  view with state -> modal(backend)

Behavioral patterns
  --> Focused on the communication between objects
Types
  --> Observer pattern  - object maintain the list of observers and notify them on any state chage
  --> state pattern - example react
